I want you to create a Tennis matching app. It will be called Tennis meet.
Each player has their own profile.
Past matches, future matches are shown.
Elo rating is shown for the players.
Each player enters their availability.
Two players can search for other players in the network and can send play requests according to the other players availability. 
Once player A sends play request to player B, player B will see the request and can accept/reject or propose another time.
Please mock any backend data, including player profiles, player logos.
Adhere to best UI/UX principles
Avoid generating too long documents like .md files, focus on functionality and aesthetic and user friendly UI.
